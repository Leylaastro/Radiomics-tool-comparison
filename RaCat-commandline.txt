#This line of code can be used in the command line to extract radiomics by RaCat. To use RaCat for radiomic extraction, after installation of RaCat, which has been described in https://github.com/EPfaehler/RaCat, for the number of images and segmentation #files that we have, the configuration file of RaCat, the image (which is a nifti file in our case), the volume of interest (segmentation file which is a nifit file in our case) and an output folder should be specified in the command line. radiomics are #extracted for the number of images given in the for loop and saved in the output folder. 

for i in `seq 58 99`; do config-RaCat.ini --img 0$i-IUCPQ_ct.nii --voi 0$i-IUCPQ_seg.nii --out RaCat_Nifti $i; done
